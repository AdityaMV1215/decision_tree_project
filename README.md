# Decision Tree Project

## What have we learnt so far 
We have seen how to clean the data and how to select features and learnt how to apply the following:

- Feature Engineering
- Feature Selection
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression

## Why solve this assignment?

-- By the completing this Assignment --

* you will get hands-on practice on how decision tree is performing for both classification and Regression and how it is different from the Linear regression and Logistic Regression

* Implementation of Grid search cv and Randomized search Cv
* You will get to learn how hyper parameter tuning helps in model performance

## About the dataset
***
** For Decision tree Regressor**
* we are using the same dataset of Housing prices, we had used for Linear Regression 

** For Decision tree Classifier**
* we are using the same dataset of Loan Prediction, we had used it earlier in Logistic Regression
